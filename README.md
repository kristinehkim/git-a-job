## General Information
If it is the first time to the site, the user will sign up with their name, email, and password to enter.  If the user has already signed up, they will login with their email and password.  Once logged in, all the posts that have been made will be displayed.  If they are the owner of the post, a delete button for that post will show so only they can delete it.  Then when an individual post is clicked on, it takes you to a page where the post is shown, comments made to that post are listed, and there is a clickable link to "Make a Comment."  When the "Make a Comment" link is clicked, the user can enter a comment to make on that post, and it will show up under the list of comments once it is submitted.  From there, the user can return to a list of all posts by clicking the "All Posts" link.
<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->
